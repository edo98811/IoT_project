The proposed IoT distributed platform aims to make patients' life safer and easier, while making clinicians' assistance more immediate and cost-efficient. In particular, the system manages the comunication between personal wearable devices and reference doctors, storing historical interesting data (depending on the desease being monitored) and providing alarm to clinicians in case of critical events detected. Moreover, the system is capable of helping patients in self-therapies (where possible and needed) through a Telegram bot. We are going to develop detailed code to manage three exemplary disease-specific services, but the platform will be structured (standardized data format and communication paradigm) in well defined blocks, in order to easily add new monitoring system, only adding message content, graphical objects, or specific needed actions.
The first service explains the capability to react to incoming critical events with immediate clinicians aknowledgment and intervention: cardiac rithms monitoring through wearable ECG system, which detects incoming stroke and alerts personal doctor and nearest subscribed local clinic with ECG data and location of the patient.
The second service explains the capability to trigger self-therapy in patients: glicemic index smart device, which monitors real time and comunicate with the patient through Telegram bot, ipo/iper-glycemia status, in order to induce him/her to assume appropriate medicines.
The third service explains the capability to store quantitative data useful for future clinic observations: sensorized orthopedic corset, which detects when the device has been weared and viceversa, and collects quantitative data of interest for next therapy phases.
